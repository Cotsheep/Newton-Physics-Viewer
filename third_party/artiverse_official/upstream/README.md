We present **Artiverse**, a diverse and physically grounded dataset of high-quality articulated 3D objects designed for realistic functional modeling and simulation.

Artiverse contains **5.4K** human-authored objects across **88 categories**, aggregated from multiple 3D static repositories. Objects are annotated with functional parts, interior structures, realistic kinematic relationships and articulated joints (including multi-DoF joints), and physical attributes such as metric scale, material, and mass.

## Data

The Artiverse dataset is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/3dlg-hcvc/artiverse).

Please follow the dataset card for access and terms. After approval, authenticate with the Hugging Face CLI and download with Git LFS:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/3dlg-hcvc/artiverse
```

## TODO

- [ ] [3.5k/5.4k] Release data.
- [ ] Release cleanup pass.
- [ ] Release functional USD.
- [X] Deploy data viewer.
- [ ] Release pipeline code.
